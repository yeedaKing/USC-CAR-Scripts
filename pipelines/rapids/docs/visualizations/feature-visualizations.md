# Feature Visualizations

## 1. Heatmap Correlation Matrix
Columns and rows are the behavioral features computed in RAPIDS, cellsâ€™ color represents the correlation coefficient between all days of data for every pair of features of all participants. 

The user can specify a minimum number of observations ([time segment](../../setup/configuration#time-segments) instances) required to compute the correlation between two features using the `MIN_ROWS_RATIO` parameter (0.5 by default) and the correlation method (Pearson, Spearman or Kendall) with the `CORR_METHOD` parameter. In addition, this plot can be configured to only display correlation coefficients above a threshold using the `CORR_THRESHOLD` parameter (0.1 by default).
